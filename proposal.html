                <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            </header>
            
            <h3>Question of Interest</h3>
                <p>Our overall question of interest is: How can university students find compatible roommates for on-campus housing? This is a particular problem at the University of Washington because it is challenging and risky to remotely connect with strangers. Also, the existing platform makes it difficult to “match” with roommates with the same preferences before room assignment.</p>

            <h3>Information Technology Problem</h3>
                <p>An information technology problem that is unaddressed in finding a roommate at UW is that there is not a conventional or organizationally offered platform from the university to help university students find a roommate. Some other problems related to finding a roommate on-campus include the lack of being informed of living habits, common interests, communication barriers, and the consolidation/organization of student information.</p>

            <h3>Existing Web Apps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> One existing attempt to solve this problem is a website called <a href="https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiIxNTM1MTE3NzIxNiJ9/all" target="_blank">Yammer</a>, it is a social networking service that is used within private organizations for communication. Currently, UW’s Housing and Food Services (HFS) has suggested students who are applying for housing to use the platform.</li>

                    <li>Another existing attempt is <a href="https://www.roomsurf.com/" target="_blank">Roomsurf</a>, this website is dedicated to match college students with roommates by creating an account and taking a roommate matching quiz.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Personal Problems</h3>
                <p>Being contracted to live with a stranger for 9 months or more whom you will have very little time to know before final room assignments is inconvenient for many university students. This inconvenience could snowball into larger problems such as academic demotivation and negative mental health consequences simply because of their undesirable living environments. Because much of student registration information and planning takes place on web applications, it seems most appropriate to take advantage of that familiarity and convenience and solve this problem to match roommates with a web application. A web application is very dynamic in what can be put in and what can be displayed, so we find it will be very feasible to construct and improve our solution through a web application.</p>

                <h2>App Description</h2>
            </header>

            <h3>Users of Web Application</h3>
                <p>The main users of the application at the current moment would be University of Washington students; however, we can consider the possibility of extending this service to other universities or related people (e.g. faculty, people in the area).</p>

            <h3>Viewable Information (Data)</h3>
                <p>The information that these users will be viewing are going to be information that they input themselves and display for others to view. Examples may include basic biographical information, plans, and habits all condensed into a personal profile that they manage. Further information to be viewed would include available dorm halls/rooms. While there is no extractable data on the Internet pertaining to the dorms/apartments, we’ve constructed a simple csv file listing all of the possible options and their basic information (HERE).</p>

            <h3>Expected Interactive Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each student will be able to input their own information to the website and also be able to filter through other students who have similar interests. This web app will become a social networking site to address the difficulties of finding a roommate on-campus.</li>

                    <li>The kind of interaction we are expecting to provide is a form/questionnaire detailing basic personal information, interests, and plans for each student.</li>

                    <li>Another interaction we are expecting to provide is the ability to contact potential roommates via text-based chat. If a user comes across a roommate that they think is a good match for them, they will be able to contact them immediately. This addresses the issue of privacy as well in the sense that users will not need to publicly display their contact information if they feel uncomfortable doing so.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>How is this a solution?</h3>
                <p>Students who use this application will hopefully help them find a roommate(s) that is fit for them and be able to successfully be assigned to them before the deadline.</p>
