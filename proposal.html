        <h1>App Description</h1>

        <h2>Users of Web Application</h2>

            <p>The main users of the application at the current moment would be University of Washington students; however, we can consider the possibility of extending this service to other universities or related people (e.g. faculty, people in the area).</p>

        <h2>Viewable Information (Data)</h2>

            <p>The information that these users will be viewing are going to be information that they input themselves and display for others to view. Examples may include basic biographical information, plans, and habits all condensed into a personal profile that they manage. Further information to be viewed would include available dorm halls/rooms. While there is no extractable data on the Internet pertaining to the dorms/apartments, weâ€™ve constructed a simple csv file listing all of the possible options and their basic information (HERE).</p>

        <h2>Expected Interactive Features</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Each student will be able to input their own information to the website and also be able to filter through other students who have similar interests. This web app will become a social networking site to address the difficulties of finding a roommate on-campus. </li>

                <li>The kind of interaction we are expecting to provide is a form/questionnaire detailing basic personal information, interests, and plans for each student. </li>

                <li>Another interaction we are expecting to provide is the ability to contact potential roommates via text-based chat. If a user comes across a roommate that they think is a good match for them, they will be able to contact them immediately. This addresses the issue of privacy as well in the sense that users will not need to publicly display their contact information if they feel uncomfortable doing so.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>How is this a solution?</h2>

            <p>Students who use this application will hopefully help them find a roommate(s) that is fit for them and be able to successfully be assigned to them before the deadline.</p>
